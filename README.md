**Description**

___

- The "**Coords System**" script is a handy tool designed to assist modders and game server developers in managing and exporting **player coordinates** in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). It provides a command-line interface to save player positions and export them to various file formats.

----
**Usage**
--
___

- Use the `/getPos` command to obtain the coordinates (x, y, z) and heading (orientation) of a specific player.

-  To export coordinates to a CSV file: Use the `/exportCoords <file_name>` command. The CSV file will be created in the `exports_ryze_coords/` directory of the server.

- The "addEditor" command allows you to add a new preferred editor to the "Coords System" script. Preferred editors determine which text editor or software will be used when opening files or scripts generated by the script.

- When executing the "/listEditors" command, the script will display a list of the preferred editors along with their corresponding paths.

- The "changeEditor" command allows you to change the default preferred editor in the "Coords System" script. The default preferred editor is the editor that will be used when opening files or scripts generated by the script if no specific preferred editor is specified.
